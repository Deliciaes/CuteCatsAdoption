# Code Review

Code review written by [Linn√©a Eriksson](https://github.com/LinneaEriksson).

1. `index.php:18` - You could decide the width on the image by styling it in css. That way it's easier for other developers to find the styling.
2. `Style.css`- Remember to use the same syntax throughout the whole code. I noticed that you use camel case everywhere except for when you are naming things for your CSS.
3. Don't forget to write an alt-text to your pictures. That would be nice for the accessibility.
4. `footer.php:1-2` - You are closing two divs in the beginning of your footer. A little bit unsure why they are being closed in the beginning of this document and I‚Äôm not sure where they belong. If they need to be there it would be nice with an explanation to why.
5. `form.php:37` - It would be nice if you specified the names on your divs a bit. On this line you called your div ‚Äúblue‚Äù wich isn‚Äôt providing much information.

Really nice work and well done! I love all the cute cats! :) /Linn√©a
